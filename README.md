# Face and Motion Detection with Age Estimation

This project is an application for detecting faces, motion, and estimating the age of users using OpenCV and a pre-trained model for age estimation.

## Features

- **Face Detection**: Uses Haar Cascade to detect faces in video.
- **Motion Detection**: Employs background subtraction to detect motion in frames.
- **Age Estimation**: Estimates the age of users based on detected faces.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3 and the following packages installed:

- OpenCV

You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```
````

```

## Age Model

Download the required models for age estimation:

1. **Model Architecture**: [deploy_age.prototxt](https://github.com/spmallick/learnopencv/blob/master/AgeGender/deploy_age.prototxt)
2. **Model Weights**: [age_net.caffemodel](https://github.com/spmallick/learnopencv/blob/master/AgeGender/age_net.caffemodel)

Place both files in the same directory as `main.py`.

## How to Run the Application

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd FaceAndMotionDetection
   ```

2. **Run the Application**:

   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

3. **Stop the Application**:
   Press `q` on your keyboard to exit the application.

## Notes

- Ensure your webcam is functioning correctly, as this application uses the webcam to capture live video.
- The age model works only if the face is detected clearly.
